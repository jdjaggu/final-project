When we talk about natural beauty of Nepal, of course, we start with ‘the country of the tallest Mount Everest’, but all that takes over the entire discussion is this topic- natural and geographical diversity of Nepal. No? In fact, Nepal and diversity are like bones and flesh. So folks, having been always thinking deeply of and admiring the natural/geographical diversity of Nepal, we thought there would seldom be any better topic than this to start off with. For many who have heard of Nepal but haven’t yet got the privilege to step on its soil, the picture of Nepal they make on their mind would just be like this:
 (That’s justifiable too because mountains are Nepal’s pride)

 We know that most of the readers of this blog certainly know Nepal’s natural diversity so well and elaborating this subject matter would be some boring lecturer(ish) stuff to do.so we have described all these in the pictures listed here.It is said that “a picture speaks a thousand words”.
 Thus, let the pictures speak!

 similarly our country nepal is the garland od all the religions.Umm… ultra-interesting!!! Let’s not expand this article more; nonetheless, we can’t resist ourselves from proudly mentioning something here Socio-cultural diversity is as important and talked-about as the nation’s natural/geographical diversity. Many castes, ethnic groups, a number of languages, customs &amp; traditions all the more and above all, it’s we people that rock! How? Of course, by falling divided but standing united as ever.
 It’s our NO NO NO for fragmentation of Nepal and Nepalese!!!

Talking about the cultural sites, Pashupatinath stands as the most important Hindu temple for the followers of Lord Shiva, in the very city where Swoyambhunath is respected and visited by Buddhists and Hindus as well. Besides, people following Islam, Christianity, Kirant, Sikhism, etc. also dwell in this country with feelings of mutual cooperation, harmony, religious tolerance and ‘Unity in Diversity’.
